This repository contains Jupyter notebooks with Python code recreating selected single cell RNAseq data analyses described in [1].

### Before you can run the code in this repository
To run the code in the jupyter notebooks, you need to add the following to the repository:
1) the folder "data_from_geo" containing data from GEO, instructions for downloading the data will be provided upon public release.
2) the repository "SPRING_dev-master", which you can download from [here](https://github.com/AllonKleinLab/SPRING).

### Interactive SPRING plots
SPRING[2,3] was used to visualize in 2D and interactively explore single cell RNAseq data. [The first notebook to run](spring_save_counts_for_all_plots.ipynb) saves the count data in a SPRING-compatible format. This is done once for all SPRING subplots, even those used to vizualise only a subset of all cells.
The following tables summarizes the notebooks to locally recreate SPRING plots shown in the manuscript together with links to online versions of the plots.
